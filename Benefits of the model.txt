Benefits of the Model for Traffic Accident Analysis in Underdeveloped Counties:

Risk Factor Identification: By identifying which factors contribute most to accident severity, 
policymakers such as NTSA can focus resources on addressing those risks, such as better enforcement of speed limits 
or improving road conditions and creating road awareness .

Preventive Measures: Understanding how factors like weather, road conditions, and alcohol consumption 
affect severity allows for more targeted traffic safety campaigns.

Cost-Effective Solutions: In underdeveloped counties, budgets for infrastructure improvements may be limited. 
This model can help identify the most effective areas for improvement to reduce severe accidents.
